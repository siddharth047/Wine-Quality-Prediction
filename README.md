# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Predicting the Quality of Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis

#Abstrat

Wine classification is a difficult task since taste is the least understood of the human  senses. A good wine quality prediction can be very useful in the certification phase, since currently the sensory analysis is performed by human tasters, being clearly a subjective approach. An automatic predictive system can be integrated into a decision support system, helping the speed and quality of the performance. Furthermore, a feature selection process can help to analyze the impact of the analytical tests. If it is concluded that several input variables are highly relevant to predict the wine quality, since in the production process some variables can be controlled, this information can be used to improve the wine quality. Classification models used here is Random Forest.

#Dataset

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult:  reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g., there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.)

1)fixed acidity
2) volatile acidity
3) citric acid
4) residual sugar
5) chlorides
6)free sulfur dioxide
7)total sulfur dioxide
8)density
9)pH
10) sulphates
11) alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12)quality (score between 0 and 10)
